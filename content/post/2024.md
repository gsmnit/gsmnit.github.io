# Year 2010
I don't fully understand why 2010 was a special year for me. After this year, I slowly started my transition from a child to a teenager. who now care about passing years. who, at the end of the year, thinks about what he did the whole year and what he should do next year. So as far as I know, I am not happy with how I spent my last 7-8 years after passing secondary school. 2023 was the same. I am not happy with how I spent this year. But yesterday I watched different videos that made no sense, but I watched one video that I found not to be nonsense. This video is from YouTuber [Einzelganger] (https://www.youtube.com/@Einzelganger). In this video, he talks about self-discipline. He mainly focuses on a stoic point of view about self-discipline. And I like Stoics point of view aboutt self-disciplin. You can watch the video for more insights.

And I totally agree with this definition. I used to think about self-discipline as something related to waking up early, doing things on time, and following a strict daily routine. But self-discipline is way more than this. if you can't concentrate on doing something important and always end up missing deadlines and not fulfilling expectations of yourself and your team. Maybe you are not self-disciplined. This year, my main goal is to become self-disciplined. And I believe this goal will prepare me for success in my other goals.
Although I am writing late, "Still, I am wishing you all a happy and prosperous 2024."
